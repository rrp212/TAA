"run.sh" runs or genarates test cases:
- Run "$ run.sh -h" to check how to use it
- Run "$ run.sh -r file1 file2" to produce and run tests cases for each data structure
- Run "$ run.sh -g file1 file2" to generate an output file "file2" using the STL
  implementation of set based on the input specified on "file1". This output file "file2" can
  then be used with the "-r" flag for testing our implementations agains the STL set implementation
- Using the "-r" flag, the script produces a "results" directory with testing information:
  - Time
  - Diff comparison with the expected output according to "file2"

The "tests" directory contains a couple of test files that we have used for analysing and
comparing our data structures.

The "lib" directory contains our implementation of our choosen data structures
