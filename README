# The script "run.sh" is used to run the tests or generate new ones

## Usage:
* Run "$ run.sh -h" to check how to use it
* Run "$ run.sh -r file1 file2" to produce and run tests cases for each data structure.
  The results are left in the "results" directory.
* Run "$ run.sh -g file1 file2" to generate an output file "file2" using the STL.
  implementation of set based on the input specified on "file1". The output file "file2" can.
  then be used with this script using the "-r" flag for comparing the output of implementations
  against C++ STL's Set
  
## Results
* If it is run with the "-r" flag:
  - Diff comparison with the expected output;
  - Running time.
  
* If it is run with the "-g" flag:
  - Output provided by C++ STL's Set.

# The "tests" directory
This directory contains all the test files that were used during out analysis. It also contains
some C++ that were used for automated test creation.

# The "lib" directory
This directory contains the template classes of each one of our chosen data structure.
